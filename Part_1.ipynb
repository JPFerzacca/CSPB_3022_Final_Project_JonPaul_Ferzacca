    "## Project Overview\n",
    "The objective of this project revolves around leveraging data to make meaningful predictions about income levels. The specific task at hand is to predict whether an individual makes over 50K a year based on a variety of demographic factors. These factors range from age and workclass to education and marital status, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is fundamentally a binary classification task. Classification is a subcategory of supervised learning where the aim is to predict the categorical class labels of new instances, based on past observations. In this case, the classes are binary - either an individual earns more than 50K a year or they do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation behind this project lies in its potential real-world implications. Accurate income predictions can be immensely beneficial to a variety of sectors. For instance, financial institutions can utilize these predictions to determine credit-worthiness or loan eligibility. Similarly, businesses can better understand their customers, allowing for more effective targeting and segmentation. In a societal context, this kind of model can also help policymakers in understanding the dynamics of income distribution and formulating data-driven policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, our goal is to develop a robust and accurate model that can effectively classify individuals based on their income level, thereby providing a tool that can aid in a variety of economic and social applications. \n",

Becker's extraction procedure followed a well-defined set of criteria to ensure the selection of clean and relevant data records. Specifically, individuals included in the dataset were required to be above 16 years of age (AAGE > 16), have an adjusted gross income exceeding 100 (AGI > 100), have a final record weight of more than 1 (AFNLWGT > 1), and work more than 0 hours per week (HRSWK > 0).\n",
